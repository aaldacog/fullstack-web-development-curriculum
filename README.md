# fullstack-web-development-curriculum

This repository contains **reproducible instructional materials** for an undergraduate full-stack web development course. The curriculum was designed and refined across multiple course offerings and emphasizes **learning by doing**, **incremental competence development**, **team-based projects**, and **industry-aligned practices**.

The materials in this repository support and extend an education research paper describing the pedagogical framework, curriculum sequencing, and assessment orchestration used in the course.

## Educational Philosophy

The course design is grounded in the following principles:

- **Learning by Doing:** Core concepts are introduced through guided, in-class coding activities.
- **Incremental Integration:** Topics are sequenced to support progressive integration from frontend fundamentals to full-stack systems.
- **Team-Based Learning:** Major assignments and projects are completed in small teams to reflect professional practice.
- **Authentic Development:** Students are encouraged to work on realistic, non-trivial applications.
- **Mentored Practice:** Instructor and teaching assistant support is integral to the learning process.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized to separate **conceptual models** from **implementation artifacts**:

### Core Documents
- **Reproducible Learning Plan**  
  A semester-agnostic curriculum blueprint describing phases, pacing, learning objectives, and pedagogical strategies.

### Assessment and Scheduling Artifacts
- Summary tables describing assessment timing and orchestration
- Templates derived from detailed instructional planning documents

### Example Instructional Materials *(added progressively)*
- Sample in-class activities
- Assignment descriptions
- Project guidelines and rubrics

## Intended Audience

These materials are intended for:

- Instructors teaching undergraduate web development or software engineering courses
- Curriculum designers seeking reusable instructional models
- Education researchers studying applied computing pedagogy

The curriculum is **technology-flexible** and may be adapted to different institutional contexts, tools, and academic calendars.

## Relationship to the Research Paper

This repository complements an education research paper that presents:

- A pedagogical framework for full-stack web development education
- Longitudinal refinement of curriculum content and assessment strategies
- Evidence-informed instructional design decisions

The paper focuses on **principles and structure**, while this repository provides **implementation-oriented artifacts** to support adoption and adaptation.

---

## Reuse and Adaptation

All materials are shared for educational reuse with attribution. Instructors are encouraged to adapt pacing, technologies, and assessment weights to fit local needs while preserving the core pedagogical principles.
